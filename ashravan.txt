The restoration was a shock. One moment, Ashravan was fading, the echoes of his past lives a distant whisper. The next, a searing light, a rush of power, and then... clarity. He was whole, his mind no longer a fractured mosaic of forgotten selves. Shai had done it. He was Ashravan, and he was alive.

He found himself in a small, unfamiliar room. The air was thick with the scent of incense and something else... metal? He rose, testing his limbs, feeling the unfamiliar weight of his restored body. He was younger, stronger than he remembered. The memories, once a torment, were now a tapestry, a history he could draw upon, not be consumed by.

He left the room, drawn by the sounds of the city. The world was vibrant, alive. He walked the streets, marveling at the faces, the sounds, the smells. He felt a connection to everything, a sense of belonging he had never known before. He was no longer a ghost, a shadow. He was real.

Days turned into weeks. Ashravan explored the city, learning its secrets, its rhythms. He found work, a simple task that grounded him, gave him purpose. He made friends, people who saw him, not the echoes of his past, but the man he was now. He began to feel a sense of peace, a quiet joy he had thought lost forever.

But the past, as it always does, began to stir. Whispers, shadows, the faintest echoes of the power he once wielded. He tried to ignore them, to focus on the present, but they grew stronger, more insistent. He began to dream of the past, of the power he had lost, the things he had done.

One night, he awoke with a start. The air in his small room crackled with energy. A figure stood before him, cloaked in shadows, their face hidden. The figure spoke, their voice a rasping whisper, "The power... it calls to you, Ashravan. Embrace it, or be consumed." The figure reached out a hand, and Ashravan felt a surge of power, a familiar, intoxicating rush. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was at a crossroads. He could choose peace, the life he had built, or he could choose power, and the darkness that came with it. The choice, he realized, was his, and his alone. The figure's hand beckoned, and the city outside his window seemed to hold its breath, waiting for his decision.
